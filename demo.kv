        text: r"The SINDy method is a recently developed technique that leverages sparse regression to identify the governing equations from a given time series (Figure 1). We consider a system with state $\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\left[x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), \ldots x_{d}(t)\right]^{\top} \in$ $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ governed by the differential equation: $\dot{\boldsymbol{x}}=\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x})$."
